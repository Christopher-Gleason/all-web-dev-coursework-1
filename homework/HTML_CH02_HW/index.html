                        My favorite thing to do in my spare time is play video games. I usually play
                        PC games that I download from Steam, but I also own a Nintendo Switch, which
                        is usually for when I am away from home and wish to play portably. While
                        I prefer a keyboard for first person games, I will use a controller for platformers
                        or simulation games. Sandbox and roguelikes are my personal favorite genres
                        of games.
