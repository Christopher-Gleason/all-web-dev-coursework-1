            Check yourself before you wreck yourself. Plenty of kick 
            ups, jumps, drops, and huge berms. By the end of the 
            45-50 miles you'll be plenty tired from the constant up 
            and down nature of Mana Road. The trails all run parallel 
            to the Fountain Place paved road so they can be shuttled 
            by car. It is not hard to get to and is very fun to ride.

            Mostly dry with some small mud puddles. Plan on this 
            ride taking all day, it probably won't, but plan on it 
            anyways by starting early. Large group of trees down on 
            northern section of trail, between buckhorn and club gap. 
            Use some caution in the corners here. Built specifically 
            for mountain bikes, a flow trail emphasizes speed and 
            rhythm, featuring berms, rollers, jumps and other 
            features that are designed in a way that uses the 
            riderâ€™s momentum to minimize pedaling and braking 
            (think downhill pump track).

          You now have to ride down an asphalt trail and cut off 
          onto a gravel trail before getting back to the old single 
          track. Check your speed before rumbling over the wet 
          armored section that make a tight right hand turn into a 
          bridge. Awesome with a couple really dry spots in corners. 
          Don't miss this trail! It is typically maintained at a high 
          level due to its popularity and use.
